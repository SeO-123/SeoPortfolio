            <h2> More About me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a passionate graphic designer with over two years of experience, specializing in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. 
              My creativity and problem-solving skills enable me to transform complex ideas into visually captivating designs. 
              One of my work projects was an NFT collection named Aliens, featuring 10 unique, custom-designed alien figures that 
              reflected my ability to turn imaginative concepts into compelling visuals.
              I also specialize in webpage design and have created a variety of different web pages. Dedicated to pushing creative 
              boundaries, I thrive on collaborating with clients to bring their visions to life and aim to develop my signature 
              style as I establish myself as a leading figure in the graphic design world.
